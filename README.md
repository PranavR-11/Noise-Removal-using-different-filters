The project is an application of Linear Algebra using Matlab. The Digital Image processing aspect of Matlab is being explored. Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to create, process, communicate, and display digital images. This can be done with the help of Matlab's image processing toolbox.

In particular we demonstrated the application various filters for noise reduction. We take an image and apply filters with noise level as a parameter that user can use to observe filter behavior.

Our investigation pertains to the reduction of noise which makes the image processing techniques more accurate. Filtering the image to denoise is the first step in preprocessing. The accuracy of denoising using filters determines the quality of the entire image processing cycle.
 
With the original image displayed, ‘x’ percentage of noise level is chosen.
Then, x% of noise is applied in the form of corruption using the ‘salt and pepper’ filter. Attempts are then made to denoise this corrupted image using different filters to conclude which filter reduces the noise best with respect to the circumstances.

The filters we have used for this investigation are:
1)	Salt and pepper filter (for corruption)
2)	Average filter
3)	Median filter
4)	Hue filter
5)	Gaussian filter
